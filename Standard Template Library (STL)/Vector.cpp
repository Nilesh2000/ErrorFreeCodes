/*
Vectors are same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted, with their storage being
handled automatically by the container. Vector elements are placed in contiguous storage so that they can be accessed and traversed using
iterators. In vectors, data is inserted at the end. Inserting at the end takes differential time, as sometimes there may be a need of extending
the array. Removing the last element takes only constant time because no resizing happens. Inserting and erasing at the beginning or in the middle
is linear in time.
