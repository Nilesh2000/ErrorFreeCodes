//An implementation of the Floyd's-Cycle finding algorithm to detect if a loop exists. if exists, find the length of the loop and the starting point of the loop. Also, remove the loop from the list.

/*
Explaination :-
Let the length of the cycle be n.
Let m be the number of nodes to the cycle initially.
Let the hare and tortoise pointer meet a k steps from the start of the cycle.
Let the tortoie go through the cycle p times and the hare go through the cycle q times.
Then,
i = m + (p*n) + k
2i = m + (q*n) + k
We are using 2i for the hare since it moves two nodes at a time whereas the tortoie moves only one node at a time.
Thus,
2{m + (p*n) + k} = m + (q*n) + k
m + k = (q - 2p)n

Finding the first node of the cycle:-
Once the hare and tortoise meet, put the tortoise pointer back to head and leave hare wherever they met which k steps from the start of the cycle.
Then, of we let them move k steps the tortoise would be back at the place where they met initially.
Since m + k steps is a multiple of cycle length n, hare, in the mean time, would go through the cycle (q-2p) times and would come back to the same point
(k steps away from the cycle beginning).
Now, instead of letting them move m + k steps, if we let them move only m steps, tortoise would arrive at the cycle beginning. Hare would go be k steps short
of completing (q-2p) rotations. Since it started k steps in front of the cycle beginning, hare would have to arrive at the cycle beginning.
As a result, this explains that they would have to meet at the cycle beginning after some number of steps for the very first time (very first time because
tortoise just arrived at the cycle after m steps and it could never see hare which was already in the cycle).
Now we know that the number of steps we need to move them until they meet turns out to be the distance from the beginning of the list to the cycle beginning,
 m. Of course, the algorithm does not need to know what m is. It will just move both tortoise and hare one step at a time until they meet. The meeting point
has to be the cycle start and the number of steps must be the distance (m) to the cycle beginning.
