Insertion at the end of the list.
Insertion at the beginning.
Insertion at the nth Position.

Declare Head Pointer either globally or in main().
If declaring it in main(), pass it to the functions by reference.

Always write test cases for empty list and a list with only one node.

Use return statements appropriately to terminate from a function.

For deletion, write test cases to delete first node and delete last Node. Also write tests for empty lists.
Dletion usually involves storing the address of the node which is previous to the node to be deleted. 

Creating a temporary Pointer to store the address of the to be deleted node.
Transfer data from the next node to the node to be deleted and then delete the next node.

Maintaining two pointers fast pointer and slow pointer to find the middle of the list.
Maintaining reference pointers and main pointers to find nth node from the last.
